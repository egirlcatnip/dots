Hit the language server document preload limit of 1000 file system entries. You may want to use the "deno.enablePaths" configuration setting to only have Deno partially enable a workspace or increase the limit via "deno.documentPreloadLimit". In cases where Deno ends up using too much memory, you may want to lower the limit.
